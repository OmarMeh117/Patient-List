# Patient Record Managment System
	
Installation
-
Please have Dev-C++ or Visual Studio downloaded in order to use the code.

* While using Dev-C++ do not create a source file, but create a project file as source files do not include .h (header files). 

Project Description
- 
* A C++ Project that I created in my course to involve Object Oriented Programming and to test my knowledge on creating header files.
* Creating header files is very useful, not only will your code be easier to read by reducing the complexity and length of your code. Header files also make code reusable.
